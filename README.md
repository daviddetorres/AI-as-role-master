# AI-as-role-master
Prompts that allows you to use any LLM as a master for your role playing games.

# Instructions
1. Choose an LLM. Some options are: 
    - DeepSeek AI (this is the one that I use the most, as it's teh best keeping the coherence of the story and good support for long stories)
    - Qwen LLM (the second best option I have found, with very good formatting and decent story coherence)
    - OpenAI GPT-4
    - Anthropic Claude
    - Google Gemini (not so good with complex stories, but fast and ok for simple ones. Also, it can generate pictures!)

2. Find a prompt for the [rules](rules-prompts.md). Copy it and paste it in your LLM of choice.
3. You will be asked to define your story, ambience, characters, etc. Copy a prompt from [Example stories](stories-prompts.md) and paste it in your LLM of choice or create your own story prompt.
4. Start playing!

Notes: 
- LLMs have a limit of tokens they can process, this translates in a limited number of interactions you can have with the LLM before it starts to forget previous parts of the story. DeepSeek AI has a very high token limit (over 150), so it's the best option for long stories. However, if you want to continue a story in a new session, you can use the @save command inside your game to get a summary of the story so far, and then start a new session with that summary as the starting point.
